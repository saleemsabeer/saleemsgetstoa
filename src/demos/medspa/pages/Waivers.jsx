  { id: 'botox', name: 'Botox / Neurotoxin Consent', category: 'Injectable', content: `INFORMED CONSENT FOR BOTULINUM TOXIN TYPE A
(Botox Cosmetic / Dysport / Xeomin / Jeuveau)

DESCRIPTION: Botulinum toxin is a purified protein that temporarily blocks nerve signals to targeted muscles, reducing the appearance of dynamic wrinkles. Common treatment areas include the forehead, glabella (frown lines), and crow's feet.

  { id: 'filler', name: 'Dermal Filler Consent', category: 'Injectable', content: `INFORMED CONSENT FOR DERMAL FILLER INJECTION
(Juvederm / Restylane / RHA / Sculptra / Radiesse / Versa)

DESCRIPTION: Dermal fillers are injectable gels used to restore volume, smooth lines and wrinkles, enhance facial contours, and improve symmetry. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are the most common and can be dissolved if needed.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Immediate volume improvement with continued improvement over 2-4 weeks
- HA fillers last 6-18 months depending on product and area
- Sculptra results develop over 2-3 months and last up to 2 years
- Radiesse lasts 12-18 months
- Swelling may exaggerate initial results; final results visible at 2-4 weeks

RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS include but are not limited to:
- Bruising, swelling, redness, tenderness at injection sites (common, resolves in 7-14 days)
- Asymmetry or irregularities (may require touch-up)
- Lumps or nodules (usually treatable)
- Infection
- Allergic or hypersensitivity reaction
- Skin discoloration
- Migration or displacement of filler material
- Granuloma formation (rare)
- Biofilm formation (rare)

SERIOUS RISKS (rare but important):
- VASCULAR OCCLUSION: Filler inadvertently injected into or compressing a blood vessel can cause tissue death (necrosis) or VISION CHANGES/BLINDNESS. This is a medical emergency.

EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: If you experience any of the following after treatment, contact us IMMEDIATELY or go to the nearest emergency room:
- Sudden vision changes or loss of vision
- Severe pain that does not resolve
- Skin blanching (turning white) or dusky discoloration
- Unusual swelling or hardening

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- Active skin infection, cold sore, or acne at treatment site
- Known allergy to filler components (hyaluronic acid, lidocaine)
- Autoimmune conditions (discuss with provider)
- History of anaphylaxis
- Recent dental procedures (within 2 weeks)

PRE-TREATMENT:
- Avoid blood thinners for 7 days (aspirin, ibuprofen, fish oil, vitamin E)
- Avoid alcohol for 24 hours
- If prone to cold sores, take antiviral medication as prescribed

POST-TREATMENT:
- Apply ice to reduce swelling (10 min on, 10 min off)
- Avoid strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours
- Avoid extreme heat (sauna, hot yoga) for 48 hours
- Do NOT massage unless instructed by your provider
- Sleep elevated the first night to reduce swelling

I understand that hyaluronidase can be used to dissolve HA filler if needed.
I confirm I am NOT pregnant or breastfeeding.
I consent to dermal filler treatment.

  { id: 'sculptra', name: 'Sculptra / Biostimulator Consent', category: 'Injectable', content: `INFORMED CONSENT FOR BIOSTIMULATOR INJECTION (SCULPTRA / RADIESSE)

DESCRIPTION: Biostimulators work differently from traditional fillers. Rather than adding immediate volume, they stimulate your body's own collagen production over time. Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) and Radiesse (calcium hydroxylapatite) are the most common.

IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES FROM HA FILLER:
- Results develop gradually over 2-3 months as collagen builds
- Multiple sessions (typically 2-3) are usually required, spaced 4-6 weeks apart
- Results last 2+ years
- Sculptra CANNOT be dissolved with hyaluronidase
- The product itself is eventually absorbed; the collagen it stimulated remains

RISKS specific to biostimulators:
- Nodule or granuloma formation (more common than with HA fillers)
- Asymmetry during the collagen-building phase
- All standard injection risks (bruising, swelling, infection)
- Delayed nodule formation (can appear months after injection)

POST-TREATMENT (SCULPTRA SPECIFIC):
- Massage treated areas 5 times daily for 5 minutes for 5 days ("Rule of 5s")
- This is critical to prevent nodule formation

I understand this is a multi-session treatment and results are not immediate.
